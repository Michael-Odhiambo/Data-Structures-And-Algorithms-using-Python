ROOT.

The topmost node of the tree is known as the root node. It provides the single
access point into the structure. The root node is the only node in the tree that
does not have an incoming edge ( an edge directed toward it ). By definition, every
non-empty tree must contain a root node.

PATH.

The other nodes in the tree are accessed by following the edges starting with the
root and progressing in the direction of the arrow until the destination node is
reached. The nodes encountered when following the edges from a starting node to a
destination form a path.

PARENT.

The organization of the nodes form relationships between the data elements. Every
node, except the root, has a parent node, which is identified by the incoming edge.
A node can have only one parent ( or incoming edge ) resulting in a unique path
from the root to any other node in the tree.
