THE GAME OF LIFE.

The game of Life is defined for an infinite-sized grid. In Chapter 2, we defined
the Life Grid ADT to use a fixed-size grid in which the user specified the width
and height of the grid. This was sufficient as an illustration of the use of a 2-D
array for the implementation of the game of Life. But a full implementation
should allow for an infinite-sized grid. Implement the Sparse Life Grid ADT
using an approach similar to the one used to implement the sparse matrix.

     SparseLifeGrid(): Creates a new infinite-sized game grid. All cells in
        the grid are initially set to dead.
        
     minRange(): Returns a 2-tuple (minrow, mincol) that contains the minimum
        row index and the minimum column index that is currently occupied
        by a live cell.

     maxRange(): Returns a 2-tuple (maxrow, maxcol) that contains the maximum
        row index and the maximum column index that is currently occupied
        by a live cell.

     configure( coordList ): Configures the grid for evolving the first generation.
        The coordList argument is a sequence of 2-tuples with each
        tuple representing the coordinates (r, c) of the cells to be set as alive. All
        remaining cells are cleared or set to dead.

     clearCell( row, col ): Clears the individual cell (row, col) and sets it
        to dead. The cell indices must be within the valid range of the grid.

     setCell( row, col ): Sets the indicated cell (row, col) to be alive. The
        cell indices must be within the valid range of the grid.

     isLiveCell( row,col ): Returns a boolean value indicating if the given
        cell (row, col) contains a live organism. The cell indices must be within
        the valid range of the grid.

     numLiveNeighbors( row, col ): Returns the number of live neighbors for
        the given cell (row, col). The neighbors of a cell include all of the cells
        immediately surrounding it in all directions. For the cells along the border
        of the grid, the neighbors that fall outside the grid are assumed to be dead.
        The cell indices must be within the valid range of the grid.
