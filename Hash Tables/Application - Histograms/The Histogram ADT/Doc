 HISTOGRAM ADT.

A histogram is a container that can be used to collect and store discrete frequency
counts across multiple categories representing a distribution of data. The category
objects must be comparable.

  - Histogram( catSeq ): Creates a new histogram containing the categories provided
    in the given sequence, catSeq. The frequency counts of the categories are
    initialized to zero.

  - getCount( category ): Returns the frequency count for the given category, which
    must be valid.

  - incCount( category ): Increments the count by 1 for the given category. The
    supplied category must be valid.

  - totalCount(): Returns a sum of the frequency counts for all the categories.

  - iterator(): Creates and returns an iterator for traversing over the histogram categories.
