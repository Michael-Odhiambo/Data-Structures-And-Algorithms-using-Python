Graphical displays or charts of tabulated frequencies are very common in statistics.
These charts, known as histograms, are used to show the distribution of data
across discrete categories. A histogram consists of a collection of categories and
counters. The number and types of categories can vary depending on the problem.
The counters are used to accumulate the number of occurrences of values within
each category for a given data collection.
