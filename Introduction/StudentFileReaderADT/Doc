The use of the Student File Reader ADT makes it easy to extract student records from a text file no matter the
format used to store the data. Implement a new version of the ADT to extract the data from a text file in which
each record is stored on a separate line and the individual fields are separated by commas. For example, the
following illustrates the format of a sample file containing three student records:

                 10015, John, Smith, 2, 3.01
                 10334, Jane, Roberts, 4, 3.81
                 10208, Patrick, Green, 1, 3.95
