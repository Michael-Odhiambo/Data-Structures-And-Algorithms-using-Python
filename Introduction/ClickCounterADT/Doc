A click counter is a small hand-held device that contains a push button and a count display. To increment the
counter, the button is pushed and the new count shows in the display. Clicker counters also contain a button
that can be pressed to reset the counter to zero. Design and implement the Counter ADT that functions as a 
hand-held clicker.

- Counter() - Creates a new counter with an initial value of zero.
- add() - Increases the counter by 1.
- clear() - Clears the counter to zero.
- display() - Shows the current count.
