
A line segment is a straight line bounded by two endpoints. The Line Segment
ADT, whose operations are described below, represents a line segment defined
by points in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Use the Point
class from Appendix D and implement the Line Segment ADT.

   LineSegment( ptA, ptB ): Creates a new Line Segment instance defined
     by the two Point objects.
   endPointA(): Returns the first endpoint of the line.
   endPointB(): Returns the second endpoint of the line.
   length (): Returns the length of the line segment given as the Euclidean
               distance between the two endpoints.
   toString (): Returns a string representation of the line segment in the
                 format (Ax, Ay)#(Bx, By).
   isVertical(): Is the line segment parallel to the y-axis?
   isHorizontal(): Is the line segment parallel to the x-axis?
   isParallel( otherLine ): Is this line segment parallel to the otherLine?
   isPerpendicular( otherLine ): Is this line segment perpendicular to the
                                   otherLine?
   intersects(otherLine ): Does this line segment intersect the otherLine?
   bisects( otherLine ): Does this line segment bisect the otherLine?
   slope(): Returns the slope of the line segment given as the rise over the
              run. If the line segment is vertical, None is returned.
   shift( xInc, yInc ): Shifts the line segment by xInc amount along the
                          x-axis and yInc amount along the y-axis.
   midpoint(): Returns the midpoint of the line segment as a Point object.
