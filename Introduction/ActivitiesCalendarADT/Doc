Anyone who is involved in many activities typically uses a calendar to keep
track of the various activities. Colleges commonly maintain several calendars
such as an academic calendar, a school events calendar, and a sporting events
calendar. We have defined an Activities Calendar ADT below that can keep
track of one activity per day over a given range of dates. Select a data structure
and implement the ADT.

  ActivitiesCalendar( dateFrom, dateTo ): Creates a new empty activities calendar initialized
   to the given range of dates. The date range can be specified for any non-overlapping period. 
   The only requirements are that dateFrom must precede dateTo and dateTo cannot overlap the day
   and month of dateFrom for the next year.
  length (): Returns the number of activities on the calendar.
  getActivity( date ): Returns the string that describes the activity for
    the given date if an activity exists for the given date; otherwise, None is
    returned.
  addActivity( date, activity ): Adds the given activity description to
    the calendar for the given date. The date must be within the valid date
    range for the calendar.
  displayMonth( month ): Displays to standard output all activities for the
    given month. The display includes the year and name of the month and
    the list of activities for the month. The display of each activity includes
    the day of the month on which the activity occurs and the description
    of the activity.
