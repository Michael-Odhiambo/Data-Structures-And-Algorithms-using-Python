In the previous section, we defined and implemented the Student File Reader ADT for extracting student records
from an external source. We can define and use a similar ADT for output.

i.) Design a Student File Writer ADT that can be used to output the records by displaying them to the terminal
    in a neatly formatted fashion.
ii.) Provide an implementation of your ADT to output the records by displaying them to the terminal in a neatly
     formatted fashion.
iii.) Provide an implementation of your ADT to output the records to a text file using the same format described
      in the text.

iv.) Design and implement a complete program that extracts student records from a text file, sorts them by 
     either student id or student name, and displays them to the terminal using your ADT. The choice of sorts
     keys should be extracted from the user.
