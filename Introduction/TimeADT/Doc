We can use a Time ADT to represent the time of day, for any 24-hour period,
as the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight. Given the following
list of operations, implement the Time ADT.

   Time( hours, minutes, seconds ): Creates a new Time instance and initializes it with the given time.
   hour(): Returns the hour part of the time.
   minutes(): Returns the minutes part of the time.
   seconds(): Returns the seconds part of the time.
   numSeconds( otherTime ): Returns the number of seconds as a positive
                             integer between this time and the otherTime.
   isAM(): Determines if this time is ante meridiem or before midday (at or
             before 12 o’clock noon).
   isPM(): Determines if this time is post meridiem or after midday (after
            12 o’clock noon).
   comparable ( otherTime ): Compares this time to the otherTime to determine their logical ordering. This comparison can be done using any of
                               the Python logical operators.
   toString (): Returns a string representing the time in the 12-hour format
                 hh:mm:ss. Invoked by calling Python’s str() constructor.
