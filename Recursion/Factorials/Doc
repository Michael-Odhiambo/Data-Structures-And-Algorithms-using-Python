The factorial of a positive integer n can be used to calculate the number of permutations of n elements.
The function is defined as:

       n! = n * ( n - 1 ) * ( n - 2 ) * ... * 1

with the special case of 0! = 1. This problem can be solved easily using an iterative implementation
that loops through the individual values [1...n] and computes a product of those values. But it can also
be solved with a recursive solution and provides a simple example of recursion. Consider the factorial
function on different integer values:

         0! = 1
         1! = 1
         2! = 2 * 1
         3! = 3 * 2 * 1
         4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

After careful inspection of these equations, it becomes obvious each of the successive equations, for n > 1
can be rewritten in terms of the previous equation:

         0! = 1
         1! = 1 * ( 1 - 1 )!
         2! = 2 * ( 2 - 1 )!
         3! = 3 * ( 3 - 1 )!

Since the function is defined in terms of itself and contains a base case, a recursive definition can be
produced for the factorial function.
