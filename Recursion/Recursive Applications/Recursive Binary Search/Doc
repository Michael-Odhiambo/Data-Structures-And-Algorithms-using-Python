RECURSIVE BINARY SEARCH.

The binary search algorithm improves the
search time required to locate an item in a sorted sequence.
In searching for a target within the sorted sequence, the middle value
is examined to determine if it is the target. If not, the sequence is split in half
and either the lower half or the upper half of the sequence is examined depending
on the logical ordering of the target value in relation to the middle item. In
examining the smaller sequence, the same process is repeated until either the target
value is found or there are no additional values to be examined.
