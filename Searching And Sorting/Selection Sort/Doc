Selection Sort.

A second sorting algorithm, which improves on the bubble sort and works in a
fashion similar to what a human may use to sort a list of values, is known as
the selection sort. We can again use the set of playing cards to illustrate the
algorithm and start by placing five cards face up on a table that are to be sorted
in ascending order.
