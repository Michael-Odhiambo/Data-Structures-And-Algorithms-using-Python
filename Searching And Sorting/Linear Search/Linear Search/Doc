THE lINEAR SEARCH.

The simplest solution to the sequence search problem is the sequential or linear
search algorithm. This technique iterates over the sequence, one item at a time,
until the specific item is found or all items have been examined. In Python, a
target item can be found in a sequence using the in operator.

Finding a Specific Item

The function in Listing 5.1 implements the sequential search algorithm, which
results in a boolean value indicating success or failure of the search. This is the
same operation performed by the Python in operator. A count-controlled loop
is used to traverse through the sequence during which each element is compared
against the target value. If the item is in the sequence, the loop is terminated and
True is returned. Otherwise, a full traversal is performed and False is returned
after the loop terminates.
