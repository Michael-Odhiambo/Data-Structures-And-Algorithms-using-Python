Maintaining a Sorted List.

To maintain a sorted list in real time, new items must be inserted into their proper
position. The new items cannot simply be appended at the end of the list as they
may be out of order. Instead, we must locate the proper position within the list
and use the insert() method to insert it into the indicated position.

To find the position of a new item within a sorted list, a modified version of the
binary search algorithm can be used. The binary search uses a divide and conquer
strategy to reduce the number of items that must be examined to find a target
item or to determine the target is not in the list. Instead of returning True or
False indicating the existence of a value, we can modify the algorithm to return
the index position of the target if itâ€™s actually in the list or where the value should
be placed if it were inserted into the list.

Note the change to the two return statements. If the target value is contained
in the list, it will be found in the same fashion as was done in the original version
of the algorithm. Instead of returning True, however, the new version returns its
index position. When the target is not in the list, we need the algorithm to identify
the position where it should be inserted.
