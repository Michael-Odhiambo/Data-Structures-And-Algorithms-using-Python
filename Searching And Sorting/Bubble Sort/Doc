Bubble Sort.

A simple solution to the sorting problem is the bubble sort algorithm, which 
rearranges the values by iterating over the list multiple times, causing larger values
to bubble to the top or end of the list. To illustrate how the bubble sort algorithm
works, suppose we have four playing cards (all of the same suit) that we want to
order from smallest to largest face value.

The algorithm requires multiple passes over the cards, with each pass starting
at the first card and ending one card earlier than on the previous iteration. During
each pass, the cards in the first and second positions are compared. If the first is
larger than the second, the two cards are swapped.

Next, the cards in positions two and three are compared. If the first one is larger
than the second, they are swapped. Otherwise, we leave them as they were.

This process continues for each successive pair of cards until the card with the
largest face value is positioned at the end.

The next two passes over the cards are illustrated below. In the second pass the
card with the second largest face value is positioned in the next-to-last position.
In the third and final pass, the first two cards will be positioned correctly.
